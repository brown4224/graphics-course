I moved the Common folder into the local path.

You can change the rendering engine by changing
the flag:  False is LINES  and True is TRIANGLES
    var isTraingle = false;

You can turn on console logging of the array values:
    var isDebugg = false;


You can change the default on page load with:
    var numberOfIterations = 0;
    var degrees = 0;
